# Fresh + Surreal DB To Do List

This To Do list was created with the Deno Fresh framework and Surreal DB. It uses an API to serve the CRUD routes and Preact on the front end. Enjoy!

## Try it out

Clone the repository and cd into the file. Then run:

```
deno task start
```

And enjoy!

You'll have to do some setup with Surreal DB too which I will add to later on.
